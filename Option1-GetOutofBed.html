		<h1>Chapter 2 - Get out of bed</h1>

		<p>You decide to get out of bed. Your legs are a litle wobbly but you manage to retain your balance. To get more light in, you walk over to the curtains and open them up. The light is blinding, but after a few moments, your eyes adjust. Outside you see that you are deep within a forest. You see a single path that leads out to the edge of the forest.</p>

		<p>Looking around the room you see a door in the corner.</p>
